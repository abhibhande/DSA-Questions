Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.


On GFG Triplet Sum in Array

Given an array arr of size n and an integer X. Find if there's a triplet in the array which sums up to the given integer X.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 6, X = 13
arr[] = [1 4 45 6 10 8]
Output:
1
Explanation:
The triplet {1, 4, 8} in 
the array sums up to 13.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5, X = 10
arr[] = [1 2 4 3 6]
Output:
1
Explanation:
The triplet {1, 3, 6} in 
the array sums up to 10.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find3Numbers() which takes the array arr[], the size of the array (n) and the sum (X) as inputs and returns True if there exists a triplet in the array arr[] which sums up to X and False otherwise.
