Find the first non-repeating element in a given array arr of integers and if there is not present any non-repeating element then return 0

Note: The array consists of only positive and negative integers and not zero.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [-1, 2, -1, 3, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: -1 and 2 are repeating whereas 3 is the only number occuring once. Hence, the output is 3. 
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is not present any non-repeating element so answer should be 0.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).
