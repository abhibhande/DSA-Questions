Insert the linked list at the start and at the end
we have to handle the null pointer of the head

LinkedList: 9->0->5->1->6->1->2->0->5->0
Output: 5 2 9 5 6
Explanation:
Length of Link List = N = 5
9 0 indicated that 9 should be
inserted in the beginning. Modified
Link List = 9.
5 1 indicated that 5 should be
inserted in the end. Modified Link
List = 9,5.
6 1 indicated that 6 should be
inserted in the end. Modified Link
List = 9,5,6.
2 0 indicated that 2 should be
inserted in the beginning. Modified
Link List = 2,9,5,6.
5 0 indicated that 5 should be
inserted in the beginning. Modified
Link List = 5,2,9,5,6. 
Final linked list = 5, 2, 9, 5, 6.
