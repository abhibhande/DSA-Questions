Given an integer array ‘A’ of size ‘N’ and an integer ‘K'. Split the array ‘A’ into ‘K’ non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized. Your task is to return the minimized largest sum of the split.
A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Example 1:
Input Format:
 N = 5, a[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, k = 3
Result:
 6
Explanation:
 There are many ways to split the array a[] into k consecutive subarrays. The best way to do this is to split the array a[] into [1, 2, 3], [4], and [5], where the largest sum among the three subarrays is only 6.
