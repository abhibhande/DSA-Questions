Given a doubly linked list of n nodes sorted by values, the task is to remove duplicate nodes present in the linked list.

Solution 1
    Time Complexity : O(N)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

Example 1:

Input:
n = 6
1<->1<->1<->2<->3<->4
Output:
1<->2<->3<->4
Explanation:
Only the first occurance of node with value 1 is 
retained, rest nodes with value = 1 are deleted.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 7
1<->2<->2<->3<->3<->4<->4
Output:
1<->2<->3<->4
Explanation:
Only the first occurance of nodes with values 2,3 and 4 are 
retained, rest repeating nodes are deleted.
