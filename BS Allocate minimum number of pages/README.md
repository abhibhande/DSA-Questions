You have n books, each with arr[i] number of pages. m students need to be allocated contiguous books, with each student getting at least one book.
Out of all the permutations, the goal is to find the permutation where the sum of maximum number of pages in a book allotted to a student should be minimum, out of all possible permutations.

Input: n = 4, arr[] = {12,34,67,90}, m = 2
Output: 113
Explanation: Allocation can be done in following ways:
{12} and {34, 67, 90} Maximum Pages = 191
{12, 34} and {67, 90} Maximum Pages = 157
{12, 34, 67} and {90} Maximum Pages =113.
Therefore, the minimum of these cases is 113,
which is selected as the output.
