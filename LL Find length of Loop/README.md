Given a linked list of size N. The task is to complete the function countNodesinLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains a loop or not and if the loop is present then return the count of nodes in a loop or else return 0. C is the position of the node to which the last node is connected. If it is 0 then no loop.

Solution_1: 
    TIme Complexity : O(N)
    Space Complexity : O(N)

By Slow and fast Pointer Approach: 
    TIme Complexity : O(N)
    Space Complexity : O(1)

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
value[]={25,14,19,33,10,21,39,90,58,45}
C = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: The loop is 45->33. So length of loop is 33->10->21->39-> 90->58->45 = 7. The number 33 is connected to the last node to form the loop because according to the input the 4th node from the beginning(1 basedindex) will be connected to the last node for the loop.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 2
value[] = {1,0}
C = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The length of the loop
is 2.
