Given an integer N, print all the divisors of N in the ascending order.
 
Solution : 

Time Complexity : O(sqrt(n) + sqrt(n)  * log(Sqrt(n)) )
Space Complexity : O(sqrt(n));

Example 1:

Input : 20
Output: 1 2 4 5 10 20
Explanation: 20 is completely 
divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.

Example 2:

Input: 21191
Output: 1 21191
Explanation: As 21191 is a prime number,
it has only 2 factors(1 and the number itself).
