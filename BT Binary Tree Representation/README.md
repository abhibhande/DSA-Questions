You are given an array nodes. It contains 7 integers, which represents the value of nodes of the binary tree in level order traversal. You are also given a root of the tree which has a value equal to nodes[0].

Your task to construct a binary tree by creating nodes for the remaining 6 nodes.

Example:

Input: 
nodes = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
Output: 
         1
       /   \
     2       3
   /  \     /  \
   4  5    6   7
Explanation: 
The 7 node binary tree is represented above.
