***These BS prefix questions are the question which can be solved by using the Binary Search Algorithm. Here i am not uploading all the question as i can solve all the question and those are available on Strivers AtoZ DSA sheet

Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
