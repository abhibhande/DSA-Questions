Given an ascending sorted rotated array arr of distinct integers of size n. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is 5 1 2 3 4. 
The original sorted array is 1 2 3 4 5. 
We can see that the array was rotated 
1 times to the right.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 0
Explanation: The given array is not rotated.
